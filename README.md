# Projects_WSL

Repository related to all new data science projects, including **LLM models** and **traditional ML** approaches.

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a collection of experiments and implementations in the field of Machine Learning.  
It contains both applied projects (competitions, case studies) and research-oriented notebooks.

## 📂 Structure
- **Time Series Modelings** → Classical Econometrics and ML algorithns to predict/forecast time_series
- **Trading Competitions** → Work for the AlphaNova ML competition - Stock Return prediction
- **NLP/** → Natural Language Processing projects, including text mining, embeddings, and LLM fine-tuning.

## 🚀 Technologies
- Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit dashboards
- Data processing with Pandas & Polars

## 🎯 Goals
- Explore and benchmark different ML models
- Apply Forecasting, Classification, regression and NLP techniques
- Build reproducible pipelines for data science projects
- Experiment with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 📝 Next Steps
- Add more documentation for each project
- Improve automation and testing of pipelines
- Deploy selected models into production environments
